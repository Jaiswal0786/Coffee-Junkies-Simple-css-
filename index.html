                <p>French roast is a dark roasted coffee that is characterized by its bold, smoky, and slightly bitter taste. It is made by roasting coffee beans for a longer period of time than other roast levels, resulting in a bean that is very dark and oily on the surface. This roast level is typically achieved when the beans reach an internal temperature of around 240°C (464°F).</p>
